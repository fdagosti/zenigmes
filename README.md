# zenigmes
Education oriented website to display maths riddles and have students answer them

Basic user management, challenges and other competitive features that allows students to feel motivated to continue playing

The site can be found in [here](https://zenigmes.herokuapp.com)

The whole app is in French, as this is for the french market. There are no plan to translate it.
However, people who are willing to translate it can contact me to discuss the matter.

## Tecnical scope
This project is also for me the opportunity to learn various stacks:

* MEAN stack
* bootstrap
* TinyMCE
* JSON Web Tokens for authentication
* unit tests with Jasmine, restler and Karma
* CI with Travis
* Docker experiments

This app can be used by anyone who is interested into improving how children see maths at school
